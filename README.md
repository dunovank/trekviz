## TREKVIZ

Dashboard used to visualise how many lines and interactions characters have in the different Star Trek series (does not include the more recent series because I could not find publicly available transcripts for these).

To run this locally:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

Main libraries used are: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), [Networkx](https://networkx.org/) & [Pyvis](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
